This is a game.
Move the Pokemon by moving the mouse back and forth across the playing space. 
Catch as many of the candies as you can! 
Every one you catch will increase your score.
The bigger the candy the higher your score will increase.
Make sure to avoid the falling bombs. 
You have three Hit Points (health). 
Once you get hit three times the game ends. 
Click again to restart. 

Glitches:
Pokemon is not perfectly circular so there some area where the catcher catches things when it shouldnâ€™t.
